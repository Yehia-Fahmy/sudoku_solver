Automated Sudoku Solver
by: Yehia Fahmy

This script is one I developed to solve a sudoku board, with the option of displaying all the steps.

The global variable 'board' will contain a 2D array of integers with the initial values on the board (Empty spaces will be shown as '0').

The program will then prompt whether or not to display every step taken to solve the board

At the end the program will print out the solved board, and if board cannot be solved then progam will display failure.
